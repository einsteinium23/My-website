  <ul>
  <li><h4>Quickswitching</h4>
<p>Whenever you have a sniper rifle like the Mosin-Nagant or the SV-98, or a shotgun like the M870, make sure to quckswitch. Quickswitching is when either using the keyboard or your mouse scroll wheel, you quickly switch back and forth between your two weapons. This causes you to be able to fire much faster and also not walk slow after you shoot.</p>
</li>
  <li><h4>Close and long range combat</h4>
<p>You should always try to keep a close range and long range weapon in your inventory. This way you are prepared for any situation you might be in.</p>
  </li>
<li><h4>Teaming</h4>
<p>Don't team in solos. It shows to everyone else that you  are so bad at the game that in order to win you have to team with someone else. If you are getting teamed on in solos, play much more defensive. This also goes if you are playing in solo squads (when  you are a solo team in squads mode). If you kill the teamers make sure to spam the salt emote to make them mad.</p>
